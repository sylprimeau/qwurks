<h1>Qwurks!</h1>

<p>Have you ever found yourself doing something in a way that no one else around you does? Ever wonder if you're the only one in the world that does it or if you are simply surrounded by people who don't?</p>

<p>I sometimes find myself doing things or thinking in ways that seem "unique" because none of my friends seem to do same thing. Then I find myself wondering if I'm the only one in the world that does these things or if maybe there are others out there who share my "quirks".</p>

<p>All of us have traits that others might describe as quirky and it's sometimes nice to know that there are others in the world just like us. (Sometimes it's nice to know that there's NOBODY like us though!) And that's how Qwurks! was born. I decided to make a website around the idea.<p>

<p>If you even ask yourself whether your quirks are yours alone or if there are others in the world that share them, Qwurks! is the place where you can find out!</p>
