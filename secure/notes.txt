Ver 36
======
- load only 5 comments for posts on main page works!
- added "view all comments" link and limited homepage view to 5 comments (no scroll)
- updated policy page with correct URL

Ver 35
======
- FIXED! commenting out commentinputwrap to get rid of "add comment" on main page BREAKS VOTE BUTTON HIGHLIGHTING!!!


Ver 34
======
- comments show in reverse order on single post pages and main page
- change commentbox look on single pages (no scroll box, just flat) and on main page too

Ver33
=====
- added datestamp to commments


Ver 31
======
- commented out analytics because I don't have a code for it yet (was accidentally using esltoolchest)

Ver 30
======
- highlight yes or no for voted questions


Ver 29
======
- had to add expiry to cookies. Without it, the cookies are deleted at end of session
- $sort needs to be passed on when going to next page

Ver 28
======
- iPhone problem seems to be fixed! -- I had to use a PHP file as an intermediary to get AJAX to access the json file in the non-public dir and Safari seems to be working OK... for now.
- all files receiving data secured with specialchars
- users can enter different question types such as "does anybody else", "can anybody else", "has anybody else", "will anybody else", etc., as the wish
- policy page added



Ver 27
======
- auto-scroll comment box to bottom when submitting new comment

Ver 26
======
- add different sorts (newest, oldest, most votes, least votes)



Ver 25
======
- clear comments input box after submitting (helps prevent double-input messages)
- submit as "guest" when nickname is missing
- STILL SEEMS TO WORK OK ON SAFARI iOS


Ver 24
======
- fixed a couple of errors
	- saveVote was in the wrong place and saving no matter what
	- was passing the wrong variable to showVotebars from onLoad so fixed that too
	- STILL WORKS OK ON SAFARI iOS

Ver 23
======
SEEMS TO WORK OK NOW!
- works on iPhone! (wouldn't take cookie starting with comma)
- displays correct number of votes!
- expands comments that have been voted on!
- user's vote preserved using a cookie so that they don't vote twice


Ver 20
======
Got it working so that it opens up the questions that have already been voted on. Did this by storing a cookie with php as the page is being created and then comparing it with another cookie with JS when the user votes. Every vote stores a new value to the cookie.

Problem is that it broke a couple small things. Bigger problem is that it doesn't work on iPhone for some reason.


Ver 13
======
-OK- NOW IT'S WORKING! Comments are updating properly and displaying properly! Woo hoo!!!!!

Ver 12
======
-OK- Now the comments refresh properly when a user enters a comment! (Still missing input box after refresh though)
NOT WORKING THE WAY I THOUGHT!!!!
